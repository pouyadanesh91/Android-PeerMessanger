# In name of Allah

## Introduction
We want a simple messaging application to enable two users, chatting via bluetooth. Note that only text messages will be exchanged.

This application as you may have figured out, has two parts:

1. Finding peer: it should be possible to find & connect to peer by bluetooth
2. Chat page: it is possible to chat with peer in realtime, both sending & receiving chat messages ofcourse needs to be implemented.

#### Note
An elegant UI is desired, you can use whatever library you see fit, except anything that implements this challenge as a whole.


### Second part
For advanced part, you need to add two functionalities:
1. stabilize & make chat reliable: meaning every message you send to peer, must be delivered no matter the situation (the app gets closed, the phone battery dies out, connection break & ...), for this you can use queue for storing messaging till they are successfully received & acknowledged by other side.
2. chat list & history: use database to store messages, so that later, user can view previous chat sessions. A chat message list also needs to be implemented to be able to get back to previous chat sessions as desired.  

## Expectations
